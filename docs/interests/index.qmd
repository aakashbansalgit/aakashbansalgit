I’ve always loved gaming—chess, in particular, is a favorite because it’s such a great way to challenge my mind and strategy skills. Cooking is another passion of mine; it’s relaxing, creative, and a way to connect with others. But what truly makes me happy is giving back. I enjoy working with charitable organizations and being involved in social services. It’s incredibly rewarding to know I’m making a difference, even in small ways, and helping to bring a little more positivity into the world.
