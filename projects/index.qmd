## [Options Pricing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sg_GY57O4DvVMC8nAI4QDI3jVsIB3kR8?usp=sharing)

This project explored pricing techniques for financial derivatives using C++. Implied volatility prediction was performed using Machine Learning models like Back Propagation Neural Networks and Random Forest. Advanced Monte Carlo Methods, including Antithetic and Control Variates techniques, were implemented to price Asian and American options. Additionally, the Longstaff-Schwartz and BBSR methods were compared for accuracy and computational efficiency. The project also analyzed exotic barrier options, optimizing computations with recursive memoization techniques for "Up-and-out" and "Up-and-in" pricing models.

## [Rainfall & Runoff Prediction Using Advanced Neural Networks](https://github.com/aakashbansalgit/MATLAB)

This project focused on optimizing Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict rainfall and runoff patterns in the Lower Godavari Basin. Historical time-series data such as temperature, humidity, longitude, and latitude were leveraged to enhance model accuracy. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed to simplify the interaction and implementation of both models, paving the way for future research in hydrological forecasting.

## [Portfolio Optimization Using Monte Carlo Simulation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LKKB4yoGEodjFldARHUXsm00OMfm4VQ7?usp=sharing)

This project aimed to identify the Markowitz optimal return by employing Monte Carlo Simulation techniques. Using Python, portfolio optimization techniques were applied to balance risk and return, providing actionable investment strategies for diverse market scenarios.

## [Hidden Markov Model for Risk and Return Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18sHAwOSy6eqa_je0hpfOpTlwV6wsXms2?usp=sharing)

In this project, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) were developed using the Python hmmlearn library to predict financial returns and Value at Risk (VaR). The HMM framework enabled capturing the probabilistic transitions of market states, offering valuable insights for strategic financial decision-making.

## Revenue Forecasting & Risk Analysis

This project involved forecasting revenue growth for a dataset with over 4,000 features. Techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, advanced optimization, and hyperparameter tuning were employed using Python libraries like JAX and Optax. The project also explored Hidden Markov Models for predicting returns and calculating Value at Risk, alongside Monte Carlo Simulation for portfolio optimization and risk analysis.

## Comprehensive Business Risk Evaluation

A robust analysis of business risks, including systematic and unsystematic risks, was conducted to evaluate financial, operational, and total leverage for competitor firms. Using financial models and simulations, the project aimed to interpret optimal capital structures for publicly traded stocks. This comprehensive approach provided actionable insights into business dynamics and capital strategy.
