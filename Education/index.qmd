I am currently pursuing an MS in Financial Engineering(2024-25) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am privileged to be part of a diverse and dynamic cohort. The program has provided me with a rigorous curriculum that combines quantitative finance and computational techniques with real-world applications. Courses like Numerical Methods, Stochastic Calculus, and Financial Computing together with courses like Financial Derivatives and Applied portfolio management have developed my quantitative skills, while group projects and case studies have fostered a spirit of collaboration and innovation. This enriching experience has equipped me to tackle the challenges of modern financial markets with confidence and adaptability.
